<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you started Erlang in 1985, you had some pretty specific
targets to go after in PLEX. E.g. handling a very large number of
concurrent activities, soft real time performance, distribution,
continuous operations, and so on.

<p>
This question may be to Bjarne and Mike, but anyone feel free to
contribute - what were some fundamental lessons learned from AKE -
this is the precursor of AXE/PLEX - that were codified in the
Ericsson engineering mindset in 1985.
</p>

<p>
E.g. one observation in Joe's history of Erlang was "The design of
AXE and PLEX used a mixture of hardware protection and data copying
that eliminated the use of pointers and corrected many of the errors
in the AKE."

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bjarne you had some foramtive experience earlier with Lisp. Ericsson
had seen great improvements in AXE over AKE. Joe was a physicist and
had experience with rockets. What are some of the ideas or
influences that weighed heavily as you set out to find a language to
improve on PLEX?

Ericsson's software problem". Could you describe some of those

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Joe, Chuck Moore, creator of Forth, said that "compilers are
probably the worst code ever written. They are written by someone
who has never written a compiler before and will never do so again."
The design of your original abstract machine, the JAM, survives in
large part as the BEAM today. How the hell did you do that?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Robert, are you familiar with this "Virding's first rule of
programming?"

<pre class="example">
Any sufficiently complicated concurrent program in
another language contains an ad hoc informally-specified bug-ridden
slow implementation of half of Erlang.

<p>
A lot of people might just think you're being clever there. For the
record, what makes concurrency so hard?

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Philip Wadler enters the ecosystem and works on a type system for
Erlang. By some measure he fails, but does succeed in creating a
type specification, which in turn enables dialyzer and other tooling
that use type information. What makes Erlang resistant to being a
statically typed language?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Does this &lt;quality of Erlang&gt; contribute to your approaches to
statically vs dynamically typed languages? Robert, I've heard you
say at times that you're not a type person.

sources, we wouldn't be here today. Could you tell us that story?

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Jane you bring a perspective that is hard to come by in Erlang
developer circles as you have interface with those who are seeing
this technology for the first time and being asked to make some
important strategic decisions in adopting it as a core
technology. What's been the most challenging part of those
discussions?
</li>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-3"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> Mission accomplished?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Here's a short list of some companies - you may have heard of some:
IBM, VISA, Facebook, BT Mobile, Pivotal, WhatsApp - and a telecom
startup called Ericsson. Each company uses Erlang in variying
degrees - for some it's a small line of business, for others it's
core to their business.

<p>
Let me now read off the ten requirements that were outlined going
into Erlang's research and development. As I read these, I want
everyone to imagine how each of these requirements potentially fits
into products they work on or know of.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Handling a very large number of concurrent activities
</li>

<li>Actions to be performed at a certain point of time or within a
certain time
</li>

<li>Systems distributed over several computers
</li>

<li>Interaction with hardware
</li>

<li>Very large software systems
</li>

<li>Complex functionality such as feature interaction
</li>

<li>Continuous operation over several years
</li>

<li>Software maintenance (reconfiguration, etc.) without stopping the
system
</li>

<li>Stringent quality and reliability requirements
</li>

<li>Fault tolerance both to hardware failures and software errors
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Super softball question. After 30 years now, looking at how Erlang
is used, inside Ericsson and outside, are you all comfortable saying
"missing accopmlished?"
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-4"><span class="section-number-3">4.4</span> Elixir</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Elixir&#x2026; This is a new language, similar to Erlang semantically but
with some novel innovations like macros and function call
piping. Apart from it's kinder and gentler syntax - so some say -
people are attracted to Elixir's now outstanding toolchain and
documentation&#x2026;

<p>
Mix for building, Distillery for deployment, ExUnit for testing,
getting started guides that focus on developer understanding and
productivity, extensive language documentation, and a web framework
that - dare I say it - sort of reminds programmers of a very popular
web framework for Ruby.
</p>

<p>
Driving this community is a small, distributed, ad hocly financed
team of very talented enthusiasts.
</p>

<p>
What can we learn about the effectiveness of community here - and
how could elements of that model be applied to Erlang's development,
which is still largely driven by a single organization.
